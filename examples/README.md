# Example Screenshots

This folder contains sanitized example screenshots demonstrating the before/after redaction process.

## Files

- **dashboard_example_before.png** - Mock Power BI dashboard with fake employee data showing names in the first column
- **dashboard_example_after.png** - Same dashboard with names redacted (white box overlay)
- **dashboard_comparison.png** - Side-by-side comparison showing the redaction process

## Important Notes

⚠️ **These examples use completely fabricated data:**
- All employee names are fake (John Smith, Jane Doe, etc.)
- Employee IDs are randomly generated (EMP-1001, etc.)
- Performance metrics are simulated
- No real company or employee information is included

## Creating Your Own Examples

If you want to contribute example screenshots:

1. Use completely fake/generated data
2. Ensure no real employee names, IDs, or metrics
3. Consider using Lorem Ipsum or obviously fake names
4. Redact/blur any company logos or identifiable information
5. Never commit actual dashboard screenshots with real data

## Visual Demonstration

The **dashboard_comparison.png** file shows:
- **LEFT (BEFORE):** Full dashboard with employee names visible in the first column
- **RIGHT (AFTER):** Same dashboard with names redacted using a white box overlay
- All other data (Employee IDs, metrics) remains visible and intact

This demonstrates how the tool preserves dashboard functionality while protecting sensitive personal information.
